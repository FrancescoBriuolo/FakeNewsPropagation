# FakeNewsPropagation
This thesis project entitled “Evaluation of graph-based techniques for the analysis of fake news and propagation metrics” involved two parallel projects. The first consists of extracting topic-specific data from the fact-checking site PolitiFact by web scraping. These data are used to construct a bipartite graph of sources and keywords, which is analyzed by considering relative projections in order to extract information about the veracity of the news. The second experiment is a study of a hierarchical propagation network for fake news detection. The goal is to use network features to implement multiple machine learning models and a Feedforward neural network for fake news detection using data provided by the FakeNewsNet dataset and perform a sensitivity analysis of the classification algorithms used with respect to the features considered. ​
